## HB Configurable Scraper

A quick project built for a friend to collect data for his application. Reads a list of sites from `sites.json` and retrieves data from the selector specified in the site object. Then it'll update a Firebase document with the scraped data.

Emails a list of failures with the error messages on completion or a success message if nothing failed.
